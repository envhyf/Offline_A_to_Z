Turning on/off: 1.1 Turn on Verify the inlet is closed. Press the button of \u201cPump Box\u201d and \u201cAccessory\u201d for the power supply. Turn on the diaphragm pump (MD1) using the knob at the front panel. After the pressure is below 1 torr, turn on the turbo pumps by selecting \u201cStart All\u201d at the operating box, and let pump 1 to pump 5 reach 100% speed (this percentage should be seen on the screen). This will normally take about 5-20 min due to the different ToF. It is better to check the speed and power of turbo pumps and compare with the previous values. Turn on the vaporizer heater. Adjust the vaporizer power to keep the temperature at ~ 550 C. This will normally take 10-20 min. Open DAQ software from PC. Load TPS settings (e.g., menu1.txt) from PC internet browser (\u201clocalhost\u201d in the address bar), then click \u201csend all\u201d to apply the pre-set voltages. Verify the filament is on by looking through the window on the right side. Check the temperature after a while, which should reach ~600 C. Turn on the chopper spinning from the controller (the blue box on TOF, the operational spinning speed is 100~140 Hz due to different setting) and turn on the inlet valve for sampling. a. When the chopper position is changed on the software, the chopper should move and the air beam signal should appear. b.

Click \u201cacquire\u201d from DAQ, then click \u201cacquire\u201d to start data collection.

Turn off the turbo pumps by choosing \u201cStop All\u201d. After the turbo pumps have fully stopped, close the valve between the MD1 and a turbo pump if one just need AMS shut down for a short period (for example less than 1 day). Turn off the MD1. When the pumps are fully stopped, loose the two screws on the turbo pumps if AMS will have a long distance transport. Switch off the power supply to \u201cPump Box\u201d and \u201cAccessory\u201d.
