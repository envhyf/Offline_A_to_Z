# Procedures for filter extraction

## __<span style="color: blue;">1. Material checking list</span>__    

- [x] Targeted filters took out from freezer.      

    !!! IMPORTANT
        Remember to let those filters within sealed package at lab temperature for 1-2 hr for warming up

- [x]  Filter sample labels (stickers) 

- [x]  Clean punches and tweezers (__Careful on selecting the correct punching size__)

- [x]  Enough Milli-Q water (Remaining volume can be checked on the screen under the sink)

- [x]  Enough, clean, dry 16-mL long tubes with caps 

- [x]  Enough, clean, dry glass vials ([how to clean](./../vial_cleaning))

- [x]  Enough clean syringes and syringe filters
      
- [x] New prepared TOC standards solution.  

    === "TC stock solution (10 PPM)"
        1. Transfer 1 mL of 1000 ppm sucrose solution into 100 mL volumetric flask.
        2. Add Milli-Q water to 100 mL marker and mix well.
        3. Label the new prepared TC standard of 10 ppm with the preparation date.
      
    === "IC stock solution (10 PPM)"
        1. Accurately weight 3.497 g of NaHCO3 (reagent grade) and 4.412 g of Na2CO3
        2. Transfer the weighted amount into 1 L volumetric flask.
        3. Add Milli-Q water up to 1 L marker and mix well. (1000 ppm IC stock solution prepared)
        4. The following procedures are the same as TC standard solution.

- [x] Enough spiking solution    

    === "Purpose of spike"
        1. the internal standard for quantification.     
        2. the indicator for checking the stability of measurement and further correction.     
        3. the carrier of small particles for increasing the size (> 100 nm) to be better detected by AMS
      
    === "Preparation method"
        Currently, we are using 200 ppm of $Na^{15}NO3$ and $Na_{2}^{34}SO_{4}$ as the spike solution.   

        1. Accurately weight 0.2 g of Na[15]NO3 and Na2[34]SO4 separately. 
        2. Transfer the weighted amount into 1 L volumetric flask.
        3. Add Milli-Q water up to 1 L marker and mix well.
        4. Store the stock solution in fridge at U103.
        

- [x] Enough Levoglucosan standard solution 

    === "Purpose of levo"
        1. keep eyes on its response as daily check of all instruments' performance.     
        2. AMS spectra comparison with levo standard spectra plot to confirm AMS's thermal vaporization, etc behaving well.
        3. AMS quantification uses for data quality control.
     
    === "Details on stock solution preparation"
        Similar to spike solution, we will also prepare 200 ppm levo stock solution and store well in fridge at U103.   


## __<span style="color: blue;">2. Filter punching</span>__    
Before unpacking the filters, prepare a pre-cleaned aluminum foil,covering the punching plate, a box of lab wipe, and clean the puncher and tweezer we will use (keep in mind to double-check the puncher size).

<span style="color: blue;">2. Detailed procedures </span>
2.1 Filter selection
Print the list of sample code for analysis, e.g., location-date-size (usually 20-30 samples for one batch) for 2 times.
Label the sample
<figure class="image"> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kXq9M.jpg" width="600" alt="{{ include.description }}"> <figcaption>Fig.x Labelling on long tubes</figcaption> </figure>

Print Prepare exactly 250 mL, 200 ppm labelled NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4
Put ~50 mL solution into a small beaker for ease of use Add 150 uL into each sample

2.2 Punching

<span style="color: blue;">1. Filter punching (cutting)</span> On an pre-cleaned aluminum foil, a 16-mm punch into a 16-mL test tube, make sure labels are matched.

<span style="color: blue;">2. Filter extraction</span> Add 10 mL Milli-Q water into each test tube, sonicate at 25 C for 30 min (30 C for 20 min on 191126). Vortex the test tubes for 1 min, Transfer water extracts into the 50-mL “grelner” sample tube, through a 45-um pore size syringe filter_

!!! IMPORTANT
        The level of the right meter should be higher than 200 kpa.
