# Procedures for filter extraction

## __<span style="color: blue;">1. Material checking list</span>__    

- [x] Targeted filters took out from freezer.      

    !!! IMPORTANT
        Remember to let those filters within sealed package at lab temperature for 1-2 hr for warming up

- [x]  Filter sample labels (stickers) 

- [x]  Clean punches and tweezers (__Careful on selecting the correct punching size__)

- [x]  Enough Milli-Q water (Remaining volume can be checked on the screen under the sink)

- [x]  Enough, clean, dry 16-mL long tubes with caps 

- [x]  Enough, clean, dry glass vials ([how to clean](./../vial_cleaning))

- [x]  Enough clean syringes and syringe filters
     
- [x] New prepared TOC standards solution. 

=== "TC stock solution (10 PPM)"

    ```markdown
    * Transfer 1 mL of 1000 ppm sucrose solution into 100 mL volumetric flask.
    * Add Milli-Q water to 100 mL marker and mix well.
    * Label the new prepared TC standard of 10 ppm with the preparation date.
    ```

=== "IC stock solution (10 PPM)"

    ``` markdown
    * Accurately weight 3.497 g of NaHCO3 (reagent grade) and 4.412 g of Na2CO3
    * Transfer the weighted amount into 1 L volumetric flask.
    * Add Milli-Q water up to 1 L marker and mix well. (1000 ppm IC stock solution prepared)
    * The following procedures are the same as TC standard solution.
    ```

- [x] Enough spiking solution    

    Currently, we need to spike inorganic solution in known amount into PM extracts, aiming to:    
    * use as internal standard for quantification.
    (2) use as indicator for checking the stability of measurement and further correction.
    (3) use as indicator for checking the stability of measurement and further correction.

- [x] Levoglusocan standard
  We 
  Prepare exactly 250 mL, 200 ppm labelled NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4  
  Put ~50 mL solution into a small beaker for ease of use 
  Add 150 uL into each sample  

## __<span style="color: blue;">2. Detailed procedures </span>__    

### 2.1 Filter selection

  * Print the list of sample code for analysis, e.g., location-date-size (usually 20-30 samples for one batch) for 2 times.
  * Label the sample

__<span style="color: blue;">1. Filter punching (cutting)</span>__
On an pre-cleaned aluminum foil, a 16-mm punch into a 16-mL test tube, make sure labels are matched. 

__<span style="color: blue;">2. Filter extraction</span>__
Add 10 mL Milli-Q water into each test tube, sonicate at 25 C for 30 min (30 C for 20 min on 191126).
Vortex the test tubes for 1 min, Transfer water extracts into the 50-mL “grelner” sample tube, through a 45-um pore size syringe filter

3. Internal standards
Prepare exactly 250 mL, 200 ppm labelled NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4  
Put ~50 mL solution into a small beaker for ease of use 
Add 150 uL into each sample

!!! IMPORTANT
        The level of the right meter should be higher than 200 kpa.
