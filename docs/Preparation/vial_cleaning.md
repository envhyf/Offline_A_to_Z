# Cleanning procedures for glass vials

_Author: Yufang Hao, Mirjam Larissa_


Currently, we are using glass vials for storing the filters extracts. Compared with plastic vials, we have proven that the glass vials (Fig. 1) will provide cleaner background and reduce the risk of introducing contamination after long-term storage.

It is exteremely critical to prepare enough amount of clean glass vials confirmed via TOC analyzer. We always prepare them prior to the campaign and clean all of the used vials when all samples finished. After many tests, current protocols for cleaning can be summarized as follows:

!!! Details

        __<span style="color: blue;">A. Standard protocol</span>__

        Rinsing [^1] for 6 times ðŸ Š Shaking[^2] for 3 times ðŸ Š TOC analyzer[^3] ðŸ Š If NPOC < 0.1 ppm, pass; If not, go to step B.

        __<span style="color: blue;">B. Additional baking </span>__

        Baking ($300^{\circ}$C for 12 hr) ðŸ Š Rinse (3 times) ðŸ Š TOC analyzer ðŸ Š If NPOC < 0.1 ppm, pass; If not, go to step C.

        __<span style="color: blue;">C. Additional Vortexing </span>__

        Shaking (3 times) ðŸ Š Vortexing[^4] (99 min) ðŸ Š Back to step A

[^1]: Fulfilling the vials with Milli-Q water and then discharging the water. 
[^2]: Fulfilling the vials with Milli-Q water and shaking it with caps on. Remember to reverse the vials  during shaking to clean the caps
[^3]: Choosing the TOC protocol with one-time test for efficiency. 
[^4]: Using the multi-vortex machine and better operating when people around for safety.
