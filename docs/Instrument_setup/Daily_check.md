- [x] Air beam values should be larger than 1E5.
- [x] Flow rate should not be decreased a lot.


- [x] Labelled internal standard signal should be stable.
- [x] Signals of samples should be larger than field blanks


With Squirrel&Pika processed data:    

- [x] Peak shape, peak width, etc.
- [x] Comparison between FLabelled internal standard signal should be stable.




## EESI-TOF

 - [x] SSQ value, value
    when SSQ values too low
    
-  [x] Verify there is enough acid for analysis.
-  [x] check to make sure the drain pot is full and fill if necessary.
